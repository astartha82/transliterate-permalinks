-- LANGUAGE SPECIFIC REPLACEMENTS --

This module supports language specific variations in addition to the basic
transliteration replacements. The following guide explains how to add them:

1. First find the Unicode character code you want to replace. As an example,
   we'll be adding a custom transliteration for the cyrillic character 'Ð³'
   (hexadecimal code 0x0433) using the ASCII character 'q' for Azerbaijani
   input.

2. Transliteration stores its mappings in banks with 256 characters each. The
   first two digits of the character code (04) tell you in which file you'll
   find the corresponding mapping. In our case it is data/x04.php.

3. If you open that file in an editor, you'll find the base replacement matrix
   consisting of 16 lines with 16 characters on each line, and zero or more
   additional language-specific variants. To add our custom replacement, we need
   to do two things: first, we need to create a new transliteration variant
   for Azerbaijani since it doesn't exist yet, and second, we need to map the
   last two digits of the hexadecimal character code (33) to the desired output
   string:

     $variant['az'] = array(0x33 => 'q');

   (see http://people.w3.org/rishida/names/languages.html for a list of
   language codes).

   Any Azerbaijani input will now use the appropriate variant.

Also take a look at data/x00.php which already contains a bunch of language
specific replacements. If you think your overrides are useful for others please
file a patch at http://drupal.org/project/issues/transliteration.

UTF-8 normalization is based on UtfNormal.php from MediaWiki
(http://www.mediawiki.org) and transliteration uses data from Sean M. Burke's
Text::Unidecode CPAN module
(http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-0.04/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm).
